# BigData_Word_Cloud
Word Clouds: Word Cloud is an image composed of words used in a particular text or subject, in which the size of each word indicates it's frequency or importance.  

For the Big Data class of mine we were given a text file "abs1" and we had to divide the file into sub documents. Each paragraph should be divided into sub documents. A total of "865" files were generated in the process.  From these files we had to take 20 random files import it and create Word Clouds for each file.   

We were asked to present the word clouds in the form of panels for extra credits. So here for the 20 word clouds I have created a panel which is basically a grid like structure of 4 x 5(rows x columns).
